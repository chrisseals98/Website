# Website
This is the source code for the website I made!
This was recently updated to use angular for the web framework! Before it was just plain HTML, as it was one of the first projects I worked on after I first learned about HTML and CSS. For now, the index page will be a landing page explaining how to get around. Then a page for a simple resume with links to some projects that I made pages for as well along with a page to contact me. This files are hosted on a S3 bucket for view!
The link to the site is https://chrisseals.com!
Thank you for coming by!
