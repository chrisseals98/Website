# Website
This is the source code for the website I made!
For now, the index page will be a landing page explaining how to get around. Then a page for a simple resume with links to some projects that I made pages for as well along with a page to contact me. This files are hosted on a w3schools spaces server for view!
The link to the w3spaces page is https://chris-seals.w3spaces.com/
Thank you for coming by!
