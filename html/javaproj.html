            <h1>CSCI-1260 Java Game Project</h1>
            <p>
              For this class, we were tasked with creating a game in <b>Java</b> using the <b>JavaFX</b> platform for a desktop app. The class voted for different ideas to create a game about and we came to the idea of a murder mystery game. While creating the game we had different requirements such as using objects with inheritance and interfaces as well as using a hashmap for the actual map in the game.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game read data from a text file to start up the different items and people you interact with. It would also save the results of your game to a text file to show your score after you completed it. Some other things to note are a slide puzzle to do after you find one clue, a notepad you could use, and randomization so it was different each playthrough.
            </p>
            <p>
              My contributions to this project were the file writer file that would save the results of a game to a text file, a separate window for the application that would allow you to use a notepad to put notes down for reference, and a method to randomize the objects for a game. This project really showed me just how substantial a project can be the more ideas you add to it. It was a very good experience for me as I learned more about working in a team for a bigger project as well as more experience in OOP with <b>Java</b>. At this point, I had been using <b>Java</b> for a year, as I took AP CS in high school and CSCI-1250 the semester before.
